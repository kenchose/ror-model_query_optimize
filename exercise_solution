1. Retrieve all players, then write a program that will loop through each player and display their team name, mascot and stadium. How many queries have we done?

players = Player.all
players.each do |player|
  puts player.team.name
  puts player.team.mascot
  pts player.team.stadium
end


2. Retrieve all players and write a program to loop through each player and their team name, mascot and stadium using .includes. How many queries have we done now?

players = Player.includes(:team).where(player.team.name)
players.each do |player|
  puts player.team.name
  puts player.team.mascot
  puts player.team.stadium
end


3. Retrieve all players from the 'Chicago Bulls' by using .includes

Player.includes(:team).where("teams.name='Chicago Bulls'").references(:team)


4. Retrieve all players along with the team name that play at the 'Staples Center'

Player.joins(:team).where("teams.stadium='Staples Center'").select(player.team.name) //gets you the player names that are part of a team that plays at thee stables center

Player.joins(:team).where("teams.stadium='Staples Center'").select("*") //gets all Team columns that play at the stadium

Team.joins(:players).where("teams.stadium='Staples Center'").select("*") //gets you all players, mascots, stadium, and team id, not team name


5. Retrieve all teams that have any player that start their name with the letter 'Z' by using .includes and .joins

Player.joins(:team).where('players.name LIKE ?', 'Z%')

Player.includes(:team).where('players.name LIKE ?', 'Z%')
